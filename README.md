# ⚙️ BWMS Status Insights Dashboard

## Operational Monitoring for Ballast Water Management Systems

A smart and interactive Power BI dashboard developed to track and analyze the operational status of BWMS installations across maritime vessels. The dashboard allows quick assessment of working conditions, system distribution, and maintenance needs—essential for regulatory compliance and fleet efficiency.

---

## 📌 Short Description / Purpose

The **BWMS Status Dashboard** is a comprehensive and dynamic Power BI report tailored for marine compliance teams and fleet managers. It provides visibility into the status of Ballast Water Management Systems (BWMS) across ships, allowing users to monitor performance, detect inactive or faulty systems, and ensure alignment with international maritime environmental standards.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:<br>
• 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – Core data visualization platform for designing and publishing the report.<br>
• 📂 **Power Query** – Used for cleaning and preparing BWMS status and system metadata.<br>
• 🧠 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Powers the logic behind KPIs, dynamic cards, and conditional visuals.<br>
• 🧱 **Data Modeling** – Relationships between vessels, systems, status logs, and configuration tables were defined for seamless filtering.<br>
• 📁 **File Format** – `.pbix` used for development; `.png` or `.pdf` for snapshots or presentations.

## 🔎 Data Source

**Source**: Internal fleet management logs and BWMS equipment status records provided by Brainwave Matrix Solutions.

The dataset includes:

* Vessel Names & IMO Numbers
* System Types (UV, EC, Hybrid, etc.)
* Operational Status (Active, Inactive, Under Maintenance)
* Installation Dates
* Regional Deployment Zones
* System Capacity (m³/hr)

---

## 💡 Features / Highlights

### • Business Problem

Fleet managers and marine compliance teams often face challenges in maintaining real-time visibility of BWMS performance across multiple vessels. Manual tracking of system status and region-wise deployment makes proactive maintenance and compliance planning difficult.

**Key business questions include:**

* Which systems are inactive or require maintenance?
* What is the regional distribution of operational BWMS?
* How many vessels are operating non-compliant systems?
* Which system types are most widely used?

---

### • Goal of the Dashboard

To provide a centralized and visually driven tool that helps:

* Track operational status across BWMS systems.
* Enable proactive maintenance scheduling.
* Support environmental and safety compliance.
* Identify underperforming system types or risky regions.

---

### • Walkthrough of Key Visuals

* **KPI Section (Top Cards)**

  * Total Systems Installed
  * Active Systems
  * Inactive Systems
  * Systems Under Maintenance
  * Compliance Percentage

* **Status Distribution (Donut/Bar Chart)**

  * Visual breakdown of systems by operational status (e.g., 65% Active, 20% Inactive).

* **System Type Analysis (Stacked Column Chart)**

  * Shows how different system types are distributed across statuses and fleets.

* **Vessel-wise Breakdown (Table or Matrix)**

  * Enables quick lookup of each vessel’s BWMS status, installation date, and region.

* **Region-wise Deployment Map** *(if geo-coordinates are available)*

  * Highlights areas with high concentrations of inactive systems or maintenance needs.

---

### • Business Impact & Insights

✅ **Operational Readiness** – Know at a glance how many systems are ready, active, or down.
✅ **Regulatory Compliance** – Identify vessels needing attention to avoid violations.
✅ **Maintenance Strategy** – Plan servicing cycles based on status and type trends.
✅ **Standardization** – Discover which system types are more reliable across your fleet.
✅ **Fleet Optimization** – Make informed decisions on upgrades or replacements.
